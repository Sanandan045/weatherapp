# weatherapp

The Weather App is designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for any location they search for. The app fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can search for a location, view current weather details, and navigate to a detailed weather information screen. Additionally, the app saves the last searched location using shared preferences, allowing users to quickly access previously viewed weather data.

## Features:
